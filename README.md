Aming to Know Shader first.<br/>
Then know more basic things.<br/>

## Book: Computer Graphics from scratch
- [Book: Computer Graphics from scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/01-common-concepts.html)
  - Computer Graphics from Scratch demystifies the algorithms used in modern graphics software with basic programming and high school math.
  - So: read this after i know shder.
